#In this project I used Spotify Top 50 songs in 2001 data available through kaggle.
#I created a table to insert this data into and then queried the data with SQL:

#Creating the table:

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )


#I then inserted the Spotify data into the table using a .csv file:

#Next, I used SQL to query the data to find the following information:

#1. What are the top 10 tracks and their artists in the top 50 spotify?
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;


#2. Which artists and their songs are in the top 50 and are longer than 3 mins long?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, (duration_ms/1000) AS duration_sec
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE duration_sec >180
ORDER BY artist_name;

#3. Which song is the MOST accoustic?

SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY acousticness desc
LIMIT 1;

#4. What is the average popularity, danceability and energy by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#5. Which artists have more than one song in the top 50 Spotify list for 2021?

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT (track_name) >1;
