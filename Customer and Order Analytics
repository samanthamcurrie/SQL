In this SQL I'm querying a database with several tables in it to provide statistics about customer and order data:

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT (orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers fr all of the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb
ON cust.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January? What was the price?
SELECT product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, sum(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. What products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98191, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
sum(Quantity),
product,
sum(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg (quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust 
ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all of the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, sum (quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
